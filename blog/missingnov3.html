           <p>Hey guys it's Astro.</p>
           <br>
           <p>In todays blog imma be talking about the build video i recently put on youtube.</p>
           <br>
           <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fb_bCz4cHDo"></iframe>
           <br>
           <p>Or if you'd rather comment on the video and get my views up please click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fb_bCz4cHDo">Here</a></p>
           <br>
           <p>Anyway, a bit of behind the scenes, so when i first started making it i already had a concept in mind.</p>
           <br>
           <p><u>The Original Concept</u></p>
           <br>
           <p>The original concept was for the camera to scroll down from a view of the night-time-ish moon to a animation of BF throwing a Pokeball into the water before singing.</p>
           <br>
           <p>However i decided that i wanted a different intro, so i listened to the audio for when BF starts singing and i wrote a simple script that you will see in the dev video, that played the animation of the camera panning down to focus on BF.</p>
           <br>
           <p>I also decided that a side-on view wouldn't work for the idea i had in mind, so i changed it so BF's back is facing the camera throughout the song.</p>
           <br>
           <p><u>Feedback</u></p>
           <br>
           <p>After uploading i got mainly one consistent bit of feedback, and that was to switch the way notes are represented. Instead of having them as a 3D object, i will be switching the notes to a canvas so that they are always facing the player's screen.</p>
           <br>
           <p>Anyway, that's it for this devlog thingie, i'll add a external archive page thing with references to all the Dev and build videos at a later date if the coding stuff does well. Bye-Bye for now guys.</p>
